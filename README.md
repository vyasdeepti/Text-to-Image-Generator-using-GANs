## Project Overview

This repository implements a text-to-image generator using deep learning. By leveraging GANs, the model learns to create images that correspond to textual input, opening up possibilities for creative AI, automatic illustration, and assistive technology.

### Key Features

- **Text Embedding:** Converts text descriptions into vector representations.
- **GAN-based Synthesis:** Uses GANs to generate images from text embeddings.
- **Jupyter Notebook Workflow:** Easy-to-follow, interactive, and visual.
- **Customizable:** Easily extendable to new datasets or architectures.

## Demo

![Sample Output](docs/sample_output.png)  
*Text: "A small bird with blue wings and a short beak."*  
*Generated image above. (Replace with your actual output if available.)*

---

## How It Works

1. **Text Processing:** The model tokenizes and embeds the input text using NLP techniques.
2. **Generator Network:** The generator receives the embedded text and produces an image.
3. **Discriminator Network:** The discriminator evaluates whether images are real or generated and whether they match the text.
4. **Adversarial Training:** The networks are trained in tandem to improve the realism of generated images and the accuracy of text-image pairing.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip or conda
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vyasdeepti/Text-to-Image-Generator.git
    cd Text-to-Image-Generator
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install torch torchvision matplotlib nltk
    ```

3. **Download or prepare your dataset:**
    - See the "Usage" section for details.

---

## Usage

1. **Open the notebook:**
    - Launch Jupyter and open `gans-text-to-image code.ipynb`.

2. **Configure parameters:**
    - Set paths, epochs, and hyperparameters in the configuration cells.

3. **Prepare your data:**
    - The notebook expects paired text and images. See the notebook's instructions for formatting.

4. **Run cells sequentially:**
    - Preprocessing → Model definition → Training → Generation → Visualization.

5. **Generate images:**
    - Input your own text prompts in the appropriate cell to generate new images.

Here’s an explanation of the code you posted:

```python
import torch
print(torch.__version__)
```

**Explanation:**

- import torch  
  This imports the PyTorch library, which is a popular open-source machine learning framework used for applications such as deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing.

- print(torch.__version__)  
  This prints the currently installed version of PyTorch to the output.  
  The __version__ attribute is a string that tells you exactly which version of the torch (PyTorch) package is being used in your environment.

**Usage in Notebooks:**  
This pattern is common at the top of machine learning or deep learning notebooks to verify that the correct version of PyTorch is installed and being used. This can help with reproducibility and debugging, especially if certain features or functions require a specific version.

## Configuration & Parameters

- **Text Embedding:** (e.g., RNN, LSTM, or pretrained embeddings like GloVe)
- **GAN Architecture:** (e.g., DCGAN, StackGAN, or custom)
- **Hyperparameters:** Learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc.—editable in the notebook.
- **Dataset:** Custom or public datasets (e.g., CUB-200, Oxford Flowers).

---

## Training Details

- **Hardware:** Training on GPU recommended for speed.
- **Epochs:** Training time depends on dataset size and model complexity.
- **Checkpointing:** Intermediate models can be saved and loaded.

---

## Results & Examples

- Include sample generated images for various text prompts.
- Compare ground-truth vs. generated images if available.
- Show training loss curves for both generator and discriminator.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **CUDA Errors:** Ensure PyTorch is installed with CUDA support if using GPU.
- **Data Format Issues:** Check that your data matches the expected format in the notebook.
- **Memory Issues:** Reduce batch size or image resolution.
